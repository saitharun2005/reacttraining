what is virtual Dom?
    -virtual Dom is a virtual representation of a UI which is kept in a memory later 
    synced with Real DOM with the help of a library called "ReactDOM".

    -the entire process od updating the real DOM with the help of VDOM is called as "Reconcialtion"

JSX:-
*****

-JSX stands for Java Script and XML
-JSX is a javascript syntax extension used to create the HTML-like markup in the react.
-Actual way to create a element in react is by using a method called as,
    -React.createElement("tagname",{property:"value"}/null,content/children)
    let ele = React.createElement("div",{className:"APP"},
    React.createElement("h1",null,"Header")
  );

-JSX is not a part of react but it is recomended to use in react.

Rules of JSX:-
*************
1.every element irrespection of paired/unpaired tag both must be closed.
ex:- <h1></H1>

2.more than one jsx element is used then they must wrapped with one parent element.
ex:-
    <div>
    <h1></h1>
    <p></p>
    </div>

jsx expression:-
*****************
-jsx expression is used to call the variable, mathematical expression inside the element.
syntax:- <h1>{username}</h1>

components:-
************
-components are the files/ modules which consist of js related logics which can be reuse.

components are divided into two types:-
1.class based components(CBC):-
*******************************
-CBC is similar to javascript es6 class.
-CBC are "statefull" component beacuse of default state object
syntax:-
class person{
    constructor(name, age){
        this.name=name;
        this.age=age;
    }
}

class Child extends person{
    constructor(name, age, city){
        super(name,age);
        this.city=city;
    }
}

syntax:- 
class App extends React .Component{
    render(){
        return(
            //js
        )
    }
}
export default App;

2.functional based component(FBC):-
*****************************
-FBC are similar to JS functions.
-FBC are "stateless" component because there is no state object untill react v16.8.

syntax:- function App(){
            return(
            )}
        export default app;


         or


        const App()=>{
            return()}
        exort default App;

Note:-
while creating a react component the names must be started with capital letters.
-extension of a component file must be .jsx/.js
-calling <App/> <App></App>
